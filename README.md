# Jesse's LazyVim config

See [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) repo and [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation).

Note that the [install](https://www.lazyvim.org/installation) is literally a single `git clone` command.

## Post-install

### markdown-preview

For [markdown-preview](https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim) to work, make sure `node` and `yarn` are installed, then run

```bash
cd ~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/markdown-preview.nvim
npm install
```
